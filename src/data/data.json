  "about__collage":" For me, college days were a lot more than just completing my BCA degree. Meeting people from different places with different vibes was way more exciting than the grades. St Maryâ€™s College was a perfect place for me to spend my campus life. The academic life I had there has helped me to chose a passionate career path and more importantly finding some cool people to have around me."
